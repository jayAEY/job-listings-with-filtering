## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I didn't realize that there was 2 options given on how to handle the filtering(using data attributes to filter hardcoded HTML and dynamically adding jobs based on json data).
I would like to practice using data attributes in the future since I didn't use them here
